Cyco is a LISP based MIDI composition language.  It borrows a bit from
Common Music but has a more narrow usage domain.

Compositions are defined by creating a "project".  The project is divided
into "sections", such as verse, chorus, bridge etc.  And each section is
composed of "parts", which is where the real work gets done.   Once a
project is defined it is "rendered" to a MIDI file.

Cyco is aimed at explicit score creation and not so much as an algorithmic
score generator.  However the basic framework is there and it could easily
be extended for algorithm composition.

See index.html in the doc folder for an overview of features.
