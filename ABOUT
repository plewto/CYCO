Cyco is two projects in one:  Cyco proper and Argos.

Cyco proper is a LISP based music composition package. At the highest level
is a Cyco Project which corresponds to a single composition.  A project
contains an orchestra and a number of sequential sections.  Each section
contains several parallel parts.  The parts combine one or more instruments
together with instructions on what to play.

Rendering a project generates a standard MIDI file as output.

Argos is a MIDI routing utility. At its most basic Argos provides
connections between MIDI input and output ports, a MIDI file player, and an
on screen keyboard.

Cyco and Argos may be used independently or together.
