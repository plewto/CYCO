Section time signatures are contagious.

The time signature of a section should have zero influence on other
sections.  The following code illustrates that there is leakage between
sections.  Section A is defined as 2 bars of 4/4 time and then dumped
Section B is created with 5/4 time and section A is again dumped. Event
times for section A are altered by the creation of section B.

AN UGLY FIX:

It isn't so much that the fix is ugly as it is the underlying structure that
requires it. 

The problem was traced to the various part render-once methods which
use the current-section of the global *PROJECT* for timing information.
The fix involved changing the current-section to the proper value within
the render-once methods.  I don't like this but short of a general rewrite
do not see any other way of addressing the problem.
