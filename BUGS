Section time signatures are contagious.

The time signature of a section should have zero influence on other
sections.  The following code illustrates that there is leakage between
sections.  Section A is defined as 2 bars of 4/4 time and then dumped
Section B is created with 5/4 time and section A is again dumped. Event
times for section A are altered by the creation of section B.
