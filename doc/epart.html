            An EPART looks superficially like a FIXED-PART but is considerably more powerful.</p>

            name          - Symbol, part name.  The new EPART object is bound to a 
                            variable named name.
            instruments   - List of instruments.  All instruments are applied as a layer
                            to each event.
            :period       - Float, part duration in seconds.  By default period is the 
                            duration of the parent section.  If period is specified it 
                            should be an even divisor of the section duration.
                            The BARS function is useful for setting part periods.
            :qfn          - Function used to resolve event times. By default #'bar
            :amp-map      - Function applied to note amplitudes.  (lambda (a)) --&gt;a'
                            This function is separate from the instrument amplitude 
                            maps and is applied prior to the instrument. The function 
                            takes a single argument and returns an <a href="amplitude.html">amplitude</a>. 
                            If the argument can not be converted to an amplitude it should 
                            be passed as the return value without producing an error or 
                            warning.  This gives the instruments a chance to interpret the value.
            
                            (lambda (a)
                              (if (amplitude-p a)
                                  (* 0.5 (amplitude a))  ;; scale amplitude by 50%
                                a))                      ;; return unrecognized argument without fuss
            
            :duration-map - Function applied to note duration.  (lambda (d)) -&gt;d'
                            It takes a single argument and returns a non-negative float.
                            This function is separate, and applied prior to, the instrument 
                            duration maps.  Any argument which can not be converted to 
                            a duration should be passed as the return value without 
                            producing an error or warning.  See <a href="metric.html">metric values</a>
            
                            (lambda (d)

                                  (* 0.5 (metric d))  ;; scale duration by 50%

            :project      - Default *PROJECT*
            :section      - Defaults to current section of project.
            :events       - List, see below.
            </pre>
            
            
            The events list has the general form:
            <pre>
            :events '((:time t &lt;command&gt;  ...)
                      (:time t &lt;command&gt;  ...)

                      (:time t &lt;command&gt;  ...))
            
            Where 
            
            time t has the form expected by the cuing function qfn, For the default 
            qfn #'bar, time has form (bar beat subbeat).
            
            &lt;command&gt; is one of :PROGRAM  :PRESSURE  :BEND  :CC  :KEY  or :CHORD

            <b>:PROGRAM event   (:TIME (br bt sub) :PROGRAM p :BANK b)</b>
                     
                     generate program-change events by passing program p and bank b
                     to each instruments program-change-hook.  Note however the 
                     program-change-hook may ignore these arguments.  For that reason 
                     the PROGRAM event is mostly useful for instruments that use
                     keyswitching.

            <b>:PRESSURE event  (:TIME (br bt sub) :TO (br bt sub) :PRESSURE :START s :END e :STEPS stp)</b>
            
                     Generate series of MIDI channel-pressure events starting at 
                     time :TIME and ending at time :TO.  The initial pressure value 
                     is :START s and the final value is :END e.  Pressure values are
                     "normalized" between 0.0 and 1.0.  The number of events
                     generated is set by :STEPS stp (default 100).
                     TIME, TO, START, END and STEPS all default to their previous values.

                     All clauses have the same usage as with :PRESSURE.  
                     Bend values are normalized between -1.0 and +1.0.

                     Generates series of MIDI controller events.
                     With exception of :CC, all clauses have the same usage as with :PRESSURE
                     Controller values are normalized between 0.0 and 1.0.
            
                     With :CC ctrl sets the MIDI controller number.  ctrl may be 
                     an integer between 0 and 127 or a symbolic controller name.

            <b>:CHORD event  (:TIME (br bt sub) :KEY k :CHORD ch :DUR d :AMP a :INVERSION inv :STRUM strm)</b>
            
                   Generate chord or arpeggio (See <a href="strummer.html">STRUMMER</a> as an alternative to chord).
                   :KEY :DUR and :AMP have the same usage as the :KEY event.
                   
                   :CHORD ch - specifies what chord to play.
                               There are two ways to do this.
                               1. As a list of intervals   (0 4 7) etc.
                               2. By name using the <a href="chords.html">chords dictionary</a>.
                                  By convention chord names are enclosed in square brackets     
                                  [maj] - a major chord.
            
                   :INVERSION inv - Applies a modification to the chord structure.
                              The inv value has the form (n octave-flag transpose)
                              Where n is the inversion   n = 0   (0 4 7) -&gt; (0 4 7)
                                                         n = 1   (0 4 7) -&gt; (4 7 0)
                                                         n = 2   (0 4 7) -&gt; (7 0 4)
                             If octave-flag is true add a copy of the first note (after any inversion)
                             transposed up an octave     n = 0 octave-flag t  (0 4 7) -&gt; (0 4 7 12)
                                                         n = 1 octave-flag t  (0 4 7) -&gt; (4 7 0 16)
            
                             Finally the transpose value is a list of transpositions.
                             For each element in the transpose list the chord is copied 
                             with that transposition.  The transposed copies are applied
                             after any inversion and octave-flag modifications.
                             :INVERSION (0 nil (0))     (0 4 7) -&gt; (0 4 7)
                             :INVERSION (0 nil (0 12))  (0 4 7) -&gt; (0 4 7 12 16 19)
                             :INVERSION (0 nil (0 1 2)) (0 4 7) -&gt; (0 4 7 1 5 8 2 6 9)
            
                   :STRUM strm thickens the plot by adding a delay between chord notes.
                          strm has the form (delay (pattern...))
                          Where delay is the time delay between chord notes in seconds.
                                (pattern) is a list of how the order of the chord notes 
                                are used.   Possible directions are 
                                       :up      - reverse note order
                                       :down    - play notes in order
                                       :random  - randomly pick :up or :down
                                       :permute - play notes in random order
                                Since the strum value is saved between chord events, 
                                the directions may be applied to the next several chords.
                                Once the end of the directions list is reached.
                                Start over from the beginning.
