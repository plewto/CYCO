            The local configuration feature is provided to customize CYCO to the local environment.
            Typically this involves defining symbolic names for MIDI channels and controllers and
            creating a default orchestra.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            There is no pre-defined structure for the local configuration. The only defined value
            is the name of the file used to load the remaining configuration files.  This file is
            </p>
            
            <pre class="code">
            
            ~/.config/cyco/local-settings.lisp
            </pre>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            local-settings.lisp may be an empty file to skip loading any configuration.  However
            defining local values greatly simplifies using CYCO.</p>

            The folder Examples/local contains the configuration files used for my personal
            studio. Most of these files deal with describing the available MIDI instruments.
            The way the orchestra is structured is for each manufacture to have a defined 
            instrument, with specific instruments defined below these.  For example I have 
            several Yamaha synths, The structure for these instruments are:</p>

            An orchestra need not be structured this way, it is just the way I have done so.</p>

            Two other groups of instruments in the examples are worth looking at.
            The Emu Procussion is a multi-timbral percussion module. Several of it's programs use
            a "standard kit" for key assignments.  These standard kits all have the same compliment 
            of child instruments, such as snare and kick.   These child instruments have customized 
            keynumber-maps for use as percussion instruments.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            The other instruments of interest are the QuantumLeap Ministry Of Rock (MOR2) 
            sound library.   This group defines percussion, bass guitar and electric guitar instruments.
            The percussion instruments are similar to the Emu instruments.  The bass and guitar 
            instruments have program-change-hooks to facilitate "key-switching" </p>
