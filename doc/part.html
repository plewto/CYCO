            <p class="section-body">
            
            <a href="section.html">SECTIONS</a> are made of PARTS.  There are several 
            different types of PART, some very specific, others less so.  All PARTS
            share a few common features.</p>
            
            
            <ul>
              <li>All parts have a name and are always a child element of a section.</li>
              <li>A part may be marked as muted.  A muted part does not contribute<br>
                  when it's parent section is rendered.</li>
              <li>Parts have a 'period' which is by default the same as it's parent<br>
                  sections duration.  The period of a part may also be some fixed <br>
                  divisor of the sections duration.  When the section is rendered, the<br>
                  part is repeated as needed to every period seconds, as needed to <br>
                  to fill the section's duration.  An 8-bar section may have parts <br>
                  with 1, 2, 4, or 8 bar periods.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Specific types of PART are described starting on the next page.  The following
            functions apply to all parts.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            <b>(PART-P obj)</b><br>
            Predicate, returns true if obj is an instance of PART or one of it's sub-classes.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            <b>(MUTE part flag)</b><br>
            Sets the mute status of part to flag.  A muted part is not used when it's parent section 
            is rendered.  See also <a href="group.html">Groups</a>.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            <b>(SOLO part)</b><br>
            Set part as unmuted. Mute all other parts in the same section.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            <b>(RENDER-ONCE part &key (offset 0))</b><br>
            Generates MIDI events from part specification. Returns nested list of events with form:</p>
            
            <pre class="code">
            
            ((time1 . event1)
             (time2 . event2)
              ..............
             (timen . eventn))
            </pre>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            If the part is muted returns nil.  The offset value is a time shift applied to all 
            event times.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            <b>(RENDER part &key (repeat 1)(offset 0))</b><br>
            Call RENDER-ONCE repeat times.  Returns list of events.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            <b>(CLONE part &key (newname "~A-clone")(parent nil)(hook #'identity))</b><br>
            Creates clone of part.  Arguments have the same usage as 
            <a href="section.html#clone">Section clone</a>.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            <b>(TRANSPOSE! part x &key (range '(0 127))</b><br>
            Transpose part by x half-steps.  If the part is 'non-transposable' TRANSPOSE! will
            have no effect.  The optional range argument sets the possible range of resulting
            keynumbers.  Any keynumber which is transposed outside of range it is transposed by 
            octaves as needed to be in range.  Returns part.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            <b>(INVERT! part pivot &key (range '(0 127))</b><br>
            Apply key inversion around pivot-point.  If the part is 'non-transposable' INVERT!! will
            have no effect.  The optional range argument sets the possible range of resulting
            keynumbers.  Any keynumber which is outside of range it is transposed by 
            octaves as needed to be in range.  Returns part.</p>
