            A Section corresponds to a major division of the composition and is typically defined in 
            a section file within the project directory.   Just as there is a <em>current</em> project, 
            there is also a <em>current</em> section within the current project.  Many section related
            functions use the current section of the current project by default.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Sections are created by the <b>SECTION</b> macro.</p>

            <p class="section-body">
            
            A section by itself is not too useful until <a href="part.html">PARTS</a> are 
            created within it.  Skipping over details for creating parts, a typical 
            section file will look something like this:</p>

            A section named 'verse1' is created on line 005.  It automatically becomes the
            current section of *PROJECT*, and is bound to the variable VERSE1.  The :bars keyword
            sets the section length to 8 bars.  The tempo and all other <a href="timesig.html">timesig</a> 
            related values are inherited from the project.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Starting on line 007 the section parts are defined.  
            For now there is nothing to see here...</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            On line 015 an optional GROUP object is created. Groups allow related parts 
            to be treated in mass.  Typical operations on groups include muting and soloing, and 
            possibly modifications such as transpose.  See <a href="group.html">Group</a></p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Starting on line 027 are options for muting or soloing the various groups.  Mute 
            may also be used with individual parts, as it is with v1-metronome.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Starting on line 028 the section is saved to two MIDI files. The name of the first file
            defaults to the section name "verse1.mid" and is played once (in this case 8 bars).
            The second file has the name "test-verse1.mid" and is repeated 8 times for a total 
            of 64 bars.  Both files are stored in the project's MIDI directory.</p>

            <p class="section-body">
            <b>(SECTION-P obj)</b><br>
            Predicate, test if obj is an instance of SECTION.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>(DURATION section)</b><br>
            Returns duration of section in seconds.  If a section is marked 
            as "skipped", the duration will be 0.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>(BARS n)</b><br>
            Returns the duration of n bars of the current section in seconds.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>(BAR &optional (bar 1)(beat 1)(subbeat 1)(tick 0))</b><br>
            Returns the relative time of bar beat subbeat in the current section.
            The BAR function is the default time cuing function used for event 
            specification in parts.  A cue value using bar is a list of the form 
            (bar&nbsp;beat&nbsp;subbeat&nbsp;ticks) where all values are optional.
            Thus (BAR), or equivalently (BAR&nbsp;1), returns the time of the first bar of 
            the section. (BAR&nbsp;2) returns the start time for the second bar.  Individual 
            beats are similarly specified (BAR&nbsp;1&nbsp;1) is the first beat of the first bar.
            (BAR&nbsp;2&nbsp;3) is the third beat of the 2nd bar.  Assuming the default 4/4 time
            with 4 subbeats to the quarter note, (BAR&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;3) is the third sixteenth note
            of the first beat of the first bar.  See <a href="timesig.html">timesig</a>.

            <p class="section-body">
            <b>(TBAR &optional (bar 1)(beat 1)(tsubbeat 1)(tick 0))</b><br>
            An alternative to BAR as a cuing function.  TBAR uses tubbeats (typically these are triplets) 
            instead of "regular" subbeats.  In all other aspects TBAR and BAR behave identically.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>(SKIP flag &optional (section-name nil))</b><br>
            Set Section skip flag.   If skip is true, the section will be skipped over when the 
            project is rendered.  The duration of a skipped section is 0. 
            By default skip alters the current-section.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>(RENDER-ONCE section &key (offset 0))</b><br>
            Generate MIDI events for section.  The result is a nested list of the form:</p>

            ((time0 . event0)

            <p class="section-body">
            
            The offset argument is a float which adds a fixed time offset to the generated events.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>(RENDER section &key (repeat 1)(offset 0))</b><br>
            Calls RENDER-ONCE repeat times.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>(-&gt;MIDI section &key filename (offset 0)(repeat 1)(pad-end 2))</b><br>
            Calls RENDER and saves result to MIDI file. The section name (lowercase) is 
            used as the default filename.</p>

            Creates cloned copy of section.
            
            ARGS:
              newname - A format string used by Lisp format to create name of the new section.
                        Using the default "~A-cone", the name for a clone of section foo is "foo-clone".
              parent  - The parent for the cloned object.  By default the cloned section has the 
                        same parent as the source section.  parent would be used if a section 
                        where being cloned into a separate project.
              hook    - A function which is called just prior to returning the cloned section.
                        hook should take a single Section argument and return a Section.
                        The default #'identity hook does not modify the clone.

            <b>(TRANSPOSE! section x &key (range '(0 127))</b><br>
            Transposes all constituent parts of section by x half-steps.
            A part may be marked as not transposable, in which case transpose has no effect.
            The optional :range keyword argument sets the range of excepted keynumbers. All 
            resulting keynumbers out side of range are transposed by octaves as needed to 
            be in range.   Returns section.</p>

            <b>(INVERT! section pivot &key (range '(0 127))</b><br>
            Applies key inversion to all parts of section. If a part is marked as not
            transposable, invert! has no effect.  The pivot argument is keynumber around
            which the inversion is produced.  The optional range argument has the same 
            usage as in TRANSPOSE!; out of bound keys are transposed by octaves as needed
            to be in range.  Returns section.</p>
