            A Section corresponds to a major division of the composition and is typically defined in 
            a separate file within the project directory.   Just as there is a <em>current</em> project, 
            there is also a <em>current</em> section within the current project.  Many section related
            functions use the current section as a default.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">

            A section by itself is not too useful until <a href="part.html">PARTS</a> are

            A section named 'verse1' is created on line 005.  It automatically becomes the
            current section of *PROJECT*, and is bound to the variable VERSE1.  The :bars keyword
            sets the section length to 8 bars.  The tempo and all other <a href="timesig.html">timesig</a> 
            related values are inherited from the project.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Starting on line 007 the section parts are defined.

            <p class="section-body">
            
            On line 015 an optional GROUP object is created. Groups allow related parts 
            to be treated in mass.  Typical operations on groups include muting and soloing, and 
            possibly modifications such as transpose.  See <a href="group.html">Group</a></p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Starting on line 027 are options for muting or soloing the various groups.  Mute 
            may also be used with individual parts, as it is with v1-metronome.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Starting on line 028 the section is saved to two MIDI files. The name of the first file
            defaults to the section name "verse1.mid" and is played once (in this case 8 bars).
            The second file has the name "test-verse1.mid" and is repeated 8 times for a total 
            of 64 bars.  Both files are stored in the project's MIDI directory.</p>

            <p class="section-body">

            Predicate, test if obj is an instance of SECTION.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>(DURATION section)</b><br>
            Returns duration of section in seconds.  If a section is marked 
            as "skipped", the duration will be 0.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            <b>(BARS n)</b><br>
            Returns the duration of n bars of the current section in seconds.</p>

            Returns relative time of bar beat subbeat within the current section.  
            BAR is the default cuing function for event time specifications.

                  subbeat - sub-beat within beat. Using 4/4 time with 4 subbeats per beat,
                            the subbeat corresponds to sixteenth notes (1,2,3,4).  
                  tsub    - Boolean selects if the subbeat value should be treated as 
                            "tsubeats" instead of regular subbeats.  tsubbeats usually
                            specify the number of sixteenth note triplets per beat.
                  tick    - An additonal number of MIDI clock ticks added to result.
                            ticks may be negative or positive to advance are retard an event.

            <b>(TBAR &optional (bar 1)(beat 1)(tsubbeat 1)(tick 0))</b><br>
            An alternative to BAR as a cuing function.  TBAR uses tubbeats (typically these are triplets) 
            instead of "regular" subbeats.  In all other aspects TBAR and BAR behave identically.</p>

            Calls RENDER and saves result to MIDI file. The section name (lowercase) is 
            used as the default filename.  The pad-end value adds additional time to end of 
            the sequence to allow for decay tails.</p>

              parent  - The parent for the cloned object.  By default the cloned section has the 
                        same parent as the source section.  parent would be used if a section 
                        where being cloned into a separate project.

            A part may be marked as not transposable, in which case transpose has no effect.
            The optional :range keyword argument sets the range of excepted keynumbers. All
