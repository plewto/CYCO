            <b>STRUMMER</b> is similar to EPART except with more flexible control of
            strummed chords.  As a trade off STRUMMER support for non-note events is
            not as extensive as EPART.  Another major difference is that STRUMMER does
            not use the general chord dictionary.  Instead it uses a specialized
            structure which restricts chords to those possible with a guitar.</p>
            
            <pre class="code">
            
            (strummer  name instrument &key period qfn project section events)
                
               Creates new STRUMMER part and bind to symbol name.
            
               ARGS:
                 name       - symbol (unquoted) 
                 instrument - instance of Instrument
                 :period    - float, defaults to duration of section.
                 :qfn       - Function, time cuing function, default #'BAR
                 :project   - Default *PROJECT*
                 :section   - Default current section of project.
                 :events    - Nested list of events.
            </pre>
            
            
            The events list has the same general form as with EPART.<br>
            <pre>
                ((event-1)
                 (event-2)
                 .........
                 (event-n))
            </pre>
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Each event may have any of the following clauses.  Unspecified clauses
            usually default to the previous value.</p>
            
            <pre class="code">
            
            :time         - Event time. Using default BAR cuing function time has the
                            format :time (bar beat su). 
            
            :key          - Keynumber. The STRUMMER key number is not used in the typical 
                            manner.  The pitch-class is used as normal, but the octave 
                            number selects a chord variation. In general higher octave 
                            numbers are located higher up the neck.  This is not absolutely 
                            true, often higher octaves produce chord inversions while staying 
                            more or less at the same neck position. 
            
                            Each key/chord combination has a different number of possible 
                            alternates (there are more mays to play an E-major chord on a 
                            guitar then there are mays to play a C-sharp major).  If the octave
                            number exceeds the number of alternates available, the highest 
                            possible alternative is produced.
            
            :chord        - Keyword, chord type selection.  +GTR-CHORD-FAMILIES+ is a list of
                            valid chord types.   At the time of writing these are
                            
                            :SOLO  (single note)
                            :MAJ :MAJ7 :DOM7 :MAJ9 :MAJ11
                            :MIN :MIN7       :MIN9 :MIN11 :DIM
                            :6TH :MIN6 :SUS4 :SUS2
            
            :strum        - Sets delay between individual chord notes.  The delay time may 
                            be in seconds or a metric symbol (W H Q etc...)
            
                            :strum delay
            
                            An alternate form provides delay time acceleration.
            
                            :strum (delay scale)
            
                            Where scale is a numeric scaling factor applied to the time
                            of each note.
            
                              note 0   &lt;-   time
                              note 1   &lt;-   time + (delay * scale^0)
                              note 2   &lt;-   time + (delay * scale^1)
                              note 3   &lt;-   time + (delay * scale^2)
            
                            Positive scale values cause notes to speed up as the chord is 
                            played.  Negative values slow the notes down.
            
            :dur          - Note duration, either as a float or metric symbol.
            
                            :dur d
            
                            An alternate form adds random variation to note duration.
            
                            :dur (d variance)
            
                            Where variance is the maximum ratio between the specified duration
                            and the generated value.  See APPROX function in CYCO/src/util/utilities.lisp
            
                            0.0 &lt;= variance &lt;= 1.0
             
            :end-together - Flag indicating if all notes should end at the same time.  
                            NOTE: the end-together flag does not apply to random variations added by 
                            the :dur clause.
            :amp          - Amplitude, either a float or amplitude symbol.
                             
                            :amp a
            
                            An alternate form allows random variations and progressive amplitude 
                            values.
            
                            :amp (a scale variance)
            
            :direction    - Selects order in which notes are played.  Possible values are
                            
                               :up   (reverse order)
                               :down (forward)
                               :coin (select :up or :down randomly)
                               :random (select notes in random order)
            
                           Unlike :strum, :dur and :amp, which are applied to individual chord notes.
                           :direction is applied to a progression of chords.  An alternate form allows
                           for a cycle of directions.
            
                           :direction (:up :up :down)
            
                           plays the first two chords in the up direction and the third chord in the 
                           down direction. The cycle repeats every three chords.
            
            :cc           - Generates a single MIDI control change.
            
                            :cc ctrl :value v
            
                            Where ctrl is a controller number or name and value is between 0.0 and 1.0
            
            :bend         - Generate single MIDI bend event
             
                           :bend n
            
                           Where n is between -1.0 and +1.0
            
            :program      - Generate program change
            
                            :program number
