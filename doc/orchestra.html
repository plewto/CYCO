            CYCO instruments are created by the <b>CREATE-INSTRUMENT</b> function.  Each instrument
            has a <em>parent</em> and may have zero or more <em>child</em> instruments.
            There is no orchestra object per se, rather an orchestra is defined by a
            tree of linked instruments.  The global variable <b>*ROOT-INSTRUMENT*</b>
            points to the top of the instrument tree for the current Project 
            <b>*PROJECT*</b></p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            An instrument inherits properties from it's parent but may selectively override them.
            The motivation for doing it this way is that often an external synth module is 
            treated as multiple instruments.   A drum machine being a prime example.  The 
            MIDI channel and program number are defined for the parent instrument, while 
            individual child instruments, snare, kick, hihat etc, define responses to 
            specific keys.</p>

            Instruments are either transient or permanent.
            Permanent instruments are protected from being purged by the <b>FREE-ORCHESTRA!</b> function.
            During project development it is common to reload all project files as 
            part of the editing process.  When a project is loaded it typically creates an orchestra
            of instruments.  <b>FREE-ORCHESTRA!</b> should be called to 
            purge the orchestra of any existing  non-transient instruments, otherwise the orchestra will uselessly contain 
            duplicate instruments.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            Instruments defined by the <a href="local.html">local configuration</a> however, should 
            not be purged.  In short instruments defined at the project level should have transient set to True 
            (which is the default).  Instruments defined by the local configuration should have transient False.</p>

            The keynumber-map is a function of one argument (lambda (k)) --&gt; k' used to customize 
            an instrument's key response. The argument k may be of any type but will typically be either
            a FIXNUM or SYMBOL.  The result should be one of the following:</p>
            
            
            <ul>
               <li>FIXNUM MIDI key number.  0 &lt;= n &lt;= 127.</li>
               <li>The value -1, indicating a rest.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-body">
            The keynumber-map should not fail if it's argument is invalid.  Instead it
            should display a warning message and return -1</p>

            <p class="section-body">
            The CYCO source file "orch/keymaps.lisp" defines several functions for

              <li>(KEYMAP name alist &key (no-warn t))<br>
                  Returns keymap based on assoc list assignments.   This is often useful for 
                  percussion instruments.<br>

                   Returns keymap which translates out of bounds keys to one of the defined values.<br>
                   circular-keymap is also usefull for percussion instruments.<br>

                      The result of calling this map is to always return 43, 44, 60 or -1.

            <b class="arg">:duration-map</b> - 
            Function, see <a href="metric.html">metric values</a><br>
            A duration-map is a function (lambda (d)) --&gt;d' which alters an instrument's response to 
            note duration.  The function should take a single argument of any type (typically float or symbol) and
            return a non-negative float.  The following map would cause an instrument to 
            play staccato by scaling duration by 50%.</p>
            
            <pre class="code">

            <b class="arg">:amplitude-map</b> - Function, see <a href="amplitude.html">amplitude</a><br>
            An amplitude-map is a function (lambda (a)) --&gt;a' which alters an instrument's velocity response.
            The function should take a single argument of any type (typically a float or symbol) and return 
            a float between 0.0 and 1.0.  The following example scales amplitude by 50%.</p>

            <p><b>:PROGRAM-CHANGE-HOOK</b><br>
            Program changes get complicated as multiple MIDI events may be required. <br> 
            Worst is that at times MIDI key events are treated as program changes.  There are
            at least three scenarios I am aware of:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Simple program change - a single MIDI program-change event.</li>
            
              <li>Program change with bank selection - In addition to a 
                  MIDI program-change event, MIDI controllers <br> 
                  are used to select
                  a bank.  Depending on the specific instrument either one or two 
                  control changes are required.</li>
            
              <li>"Keyswitching" - where specific key events are used to alter an 
                   instruments sound.<br>  
                   In my opinion this is unfortunate as it
                   mixes the semantics of playing notes with that of changing presets. <br>
                   Problems occur when applying transformations, such as transpose, to 
                   a sequence.  <br>
                   If keyswitch events are present they must somehow be 
                   protected from the transformation.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="section-body">
            
            To deal with these possibilities each instrument provides a <b>program-change-hook</b> function.
            The hook takes 4 arguments are returns a list of MIDI events.</p>
            
            <pre class="code">
            
                (lambda time cindex prognum bank)  -&gt;  list
            
                ARGS:
                   time    - float, the event time.  The value of :program-change-offset is added to time.
                   cindex  - fixnum, The "raw" MIDI channel.   For the most part CYCO uses MIDI channel
                             numbers as defined by the MIDI specifications (1,2,3,...,16).  The exception is
                             with low-level events where the actual byte values (0,1,2,...,15) are used.
                             These low-level channel values are always indicated by the word "index".
                   prognum - The program number.   prognum may be an actual MIDI program number or the 
                             the hook function may be defined to take symbolic values.  Typically 
                             prognum is supplied by the :PROGRAM-NUMBER argument above.  The hook function
                             however may be defined to ignore this value and use some internal value instead. 
                   bank    - The program bank, as with prognum, bank is supplied by the :program-bank argument
                             above.  The hook function should ignore this value if the instrument does 
                             not support banks.
                RETURNS:  nested list of MIDI events.

                    In the simplest case the result is
