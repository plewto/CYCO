            CYCO is a LISP based MIDI composition language.  It borrows somewhat from 
            <a href="http://commonmusic.sourceforge.net/">Common Music</a> but has a 
            more restricted usage domain.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Compositions are defined by creating a <a href="project.html">Project</a>,
            which establishes several global properties and is composed of a series of
            <a href="section.html">Sections</a>.  A Section corresponds to a major division
            of the composition, such as a verse or chorus.  Sections are composed of 
            <a href="part.html">Parts</a>, which combines one or more instruments with 
            instructions for what events to produce.  Once defined a project is rendered
            to a standard MIDI file.</p>
